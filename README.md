# Spark TE

Spark Transformation Engine (SparkTE), previously denoted as SparkTL, is an engine for model transformation written using Apache Spark.

SparkTE implementation is based on [CoqTL](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CoqTL-SLE2021) specification. The two tools aims at evolving in symbiosis.

This repository contains both the Coq specification of the engine, the proof of equivalence with the first CoqTL specification and the engine itself.
